# ComputerScience1

Dear friends,

This repository serves as a **review** of what I already learned in Ioduction to Computer Science. It's for educational purposes only.

The eTextbook that I purchased and used is "Starting Out With Java: Control Structures Through Objects, 8th edition" by Tony Gaddis. 

Regards,
Nabil
